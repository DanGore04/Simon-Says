# Simon-Says Game
The	Single-Player	Simon	Game	is	as	follows:	
1. Click the START button to begin, the	game status	indicator (the red/green light below the START	
button)	switches	from	RED	to	GREEN.	The	game	will	begin	3s	after	the	light	turns	GREEN.	
2. Simon	will	give	the	first	signal	(randomly	flash	a	coloured	button).	Repeat	the	signal	by	clicking	the	
same	coloured	button.	
3. Simon	will	duplicate	 the	first	 signal	and	add	one.	Repeat	 these	 two signals	by	clicking	 the	 same	
coloured	buttons,	in order.	
4. Simon	will	duplicate	these	first	two	signals	and	add	one.	
5. Continue	playing	as	long	as	you	can	repeat	each	sequence	of	signals	correctly. After	the	5th,	9th	
and	13th	signals	in	a	sequence,	Simon	automaticallty	speeds	up	the	interval	between	signals.	
6. If	 you	 fail	 to	 repeat	 a	 sequence	 exactly,
Simon	responds	by	flashing	all	four	coloured buttons	simultaneously	five	times.		This	means	you	have	lost,	
and	the	sequence	of	signals	ends.	The	game	status	indicator	switches	from	GREEN	to	RED	and	you	
will	have	to	click	START	button	to	begin	a	new	game.		
7. Your	progress	(the	number	of	correctly	repeated	signals)	for	the	active game	
is	shown	in	the	display	to	the	right	of	the	START	button.	The	all-time	highest	score	is	shown	in	the	
display	to	the	left	of	the	START	button.
